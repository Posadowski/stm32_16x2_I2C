# STM32 16x2 I2C Project

##Project Description
This project is an example implementation of a driver to control a 16x2 LCD display using the I2C interface on the NUCLEO-F411RE board with the STM32 microcontroller.

##Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following components:

NUCLEO-F411RE board with an STM32 microcontroller.
A 16x2 LCD display with an I2C interface.
STM32CubeIDE or another tool for STM32 microcontroller programming.
##Configuration
Connect the 16x2 LCD display to the NUCLEO-F411RE board using the I2C interface (SCL PB10, CDA PB9).

Open STM32CubeIDE and load the "stm32_16x2_I2C" project.

Configure the appropriate STM32 pins as I2C outputs and connect them to the LCD display.

Build and upload the project to the NUCLEO-F411RE board.
